            <h2>Who is Thala?</h2>
            <p>
                Thala, meaning "Leader" in Tamil, is the nickname lovingly given to <strong>MS Dhoni</strong>, the former Indian cricket team captain and the face of Chennai Super Kings (CSK).

                More than just a cricketer, Dhoni is a phenomenon. Known for his calm demeanor and exceptional leadership, he led India to historic victories, including the <strong>2007 T20 World Cup, 2011 ODI World Cup, and 2013 Champions Trophy</strong>—making him the only captain to win all three ICC trophies.
                
                The number <strong>7</strong> has become synonymous with Dhoni, reflecting his jersey and his birthdate, July 7th. His connection with CSK and the fans has cemented his legacy as a beloved leader who inspires loyalty, teamwork, and excellence both on and off the field.
